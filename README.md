# 16-Bit-Microprocessor-With-Single-Accumulator


The project task is to design a 16- bit Microprocessor kernel which fetch, decode and execute
Add, Store, Load, Jump, Jneg and NOP instruction and to show software simulation and hardware implementation using DE1-SoC


A basic microprocessor will have program counter register (PC), instruction register(IR), Accumulator (for storing intermediate result),ALU,MDR and MAR but in this project we exclude
MDR and we build an Memory interface(MIF), which is a input- output port, makes connection
with the external Ram memory and hexdecimal display to display output. The length of data
is 16-bit, length of instruction is 16-bit, instruction consists of 8-bit operand and 8-bit address.
